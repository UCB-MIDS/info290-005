    "# Week 2: Potential Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of potential outcomes are foundational to the reasoning system that we're going to use for the course. They allow us to think about, with considerably clarity, the comparisons that we want to make, and **exactly** why these comparisons are *causal*. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, despite the somewhat obtuse language that we might use when we're talking about potential outcomes (e.g. \"The potential outcome to treatment, when a unit is assigned to treatment.\") the math surrounding potential outcomes is actually pretty straightforward. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Create Data \n",
    "Let's make some toy data that we can use through this demo. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we have 1,000 individuals that we can observe in our study. Furthermore, suppose that for each of these people, there is some *latent*, or unmeasured, response to treatment that they *would* have to treatment if we assigned them to take the treatemnt. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might think of this as an unknowable population-level parameter that we're trying to estimate from empirical data. In this worksheet, we're going to make the data so that the causal parameter $\\tau$ has a mean value of 2. But, you could imagine that some other treatment has a mean value of 100. Or, for some third treatment it could have a mean value of zero, in which case we would say there there is *no* treatment effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "For concreteness, suppose that the treatment is assigning people to drink [coffee](https://www.aldeacoffee.com)."

One way that you might think about this is as though these are the measurement that our population of people are going to walk into the expeiment having -- but we haven't measured them yet, so we don't know what they are! That is, suppose we have the whole cohort of students who are enrolled in 241, and they're going to start the coffee drinking experiment in Week 3. In Week 2, they all are either young/old, short/tall, and have innate abilities to focus, *we as the experimenters just don't know them yet!*. \n",

    "When we run the experiment, we accomplish several things: \n",

    "1. We intervene in their lives to force a particular experience; \n",
    "2. As a result of our intervention, we *reveal* either potential outcomes to treatment or control for each subject, and we measure this. \n",
