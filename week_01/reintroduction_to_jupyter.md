# Reintroduction to Jupyter 

One of the 'off-label' goals of this course is making you *very* comfortable thinking about data in a structured way, and manipulating data in a structured way.

With this course, virtually all of our data *could*, in principle, be wrangled in a calculator. No big compute necessary here, because we're structuring the comparisons we want to observe *by design* rather than by brute force computation.
