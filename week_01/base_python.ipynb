    "Any of these, depending on the question you seek to answer, might be the the most appropriate unit of observation. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the time that you're analyzing your data you will rely on the fact that you've structured your units of observations in some meaningful way; you've stacked the measurments into a *variable*, perhaps called `daily_temp`. This variable is stored as a vector, refered to as a **list**. For the purposes of analysis, thinking at the *vector* level is probably the most useful mode of thought. "
