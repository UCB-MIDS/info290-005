Including a fixed effect term for each school removes the possiblity of inducing bias in our estimate. However, since we can't plausibly assume that the variance is the same within each of the individual school clusters, then failing to appropriately account for the empirical variance might lead us to estimate inappropriately small standard errors. Why would this be a problem? Well, if we want to falsely reject the null in only 5% of cases ($\\alpha = 0.95$), then if we make the wrong assumptions we might falsely reject the null hypothesis at higher (or even lower rates). Typically, we aren't kept up at night if we're a little conservative in our estimates, but beign too *gung-ho* is a problem. \n",
