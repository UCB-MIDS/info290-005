    "+ One that immediatly comes to mind is that perhaps students who are assigned to treatment have greater variance in their outcomes than students who are assigned to control. This could happen if there are some students who really excel in the small classroom. \n",
    "+ Another, that we aren't going to correct for in this document, but that we **certainly** should, is that the outcomes within a school might also be correlated in a way that our model is not accounting for. Including a fixed effect for each school effectively *de-means* the school effects so that we have a more precise estimate of the treatment effect within each school, but it doesn't address any of the *within* school correlation that might exist. \n",
    "+ As we talk about in the course, if we have relatively high Inter-Cluster Correlation, then our standard errors are inappropriately enthuiastic about rejecting the null hypothesis (they're too small). This is because our standard errors are behaving as though we have `N` observations, when in fact functionally we might have (many) fewer useful observations. \n",

    "The last thing here is acknowledging that we've very likely got correlated potential outcomes within schools. Including a fixed effect term for each school removes the possiblity of inducing bias in our estimate. However, since we can't plausibly assume that the variance is the same within each of the individual school clusters, then failing to appropriately account for the empirical variance might lead us to estimate inappropriately small standard errors. Why would this be a problem? Well, if we want to falsely reject the null in only 5% of cases ($\\alpha = 0.95$), then if we make the wrong assumptions we might falsely reject the null hypothesis at higher (or even lower rates). Typically, we aren't kept up at night if we're a little conservative in our estimates, but beign too *gung-ho* is a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in both *Field Experiments* and *Mostly Harmless Econometrics* the appropriate way to assess this is to calculate the estimated variance within each of the clusters and appropritely combine these estimtates. Conceptually this is pretty simple, but getting the maths just right can be a little particular. \n",
